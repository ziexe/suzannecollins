						<strong>Story</strong></br> 
						Only a few hours have passed since the closing of Gregor and the Marks of Secret, when Gregor returns from the Firelands to warn Regalia of an impending gnawer attack. As the novel opens, Gregor is numb with shock from the Prophecy of Time's apparent prediction of his death. He and his bond Ares disobey Solovet and return to the Firelands to find the terribly ill Luxa, Aurora, and Howard. Upon his return, Solovet orders Gregor locked in the dungeon as punishment for this insubordination. He is eventually released by Nerissa to help his sister Boots while the toddler works to fulfill the Prophecy of Time by deciphering the rats' "Code of Claw"

							"Perhaps Collins’s greatest achievement in these tales is the effortless introduction of weighty geopolitical ethics into rip-roaring adventure. It seems as elusive in the Underland as up above, but Gregor and his companions, including the unforgettable rat Ripred, may yet find a way. The resolution is bittersweet but faintly hopeful—a fitting end for an unflinchingly gutsy series whose deftly drawn characters have always lived dangerously."

							"Collins delivers more of what's made this series so compelling: vivid action scenes, detailed military machinations, and nuanced character development. The plot moves swiftly but with deliberation, reflecting the Regalian leaders' strategic chess-game approach to the conflict. In the end, though the unimaginable doesn't happen, no one is without physical and emotional scars. Readers, too, will be battle-weary but buoyed by Collins's ultimate message of hope. As the Underlanders would say: fly you high, Gregor."

                            <p>"Consistent quality has been a hallmark of this series. Although the story line has gradually become darker, Gregor maintains his endearing qualities as a reluctant hero. His love for his family and his compassion for his friends never flag. The world of Regalia, located below the streets of New York City, presents a magical realm of possibilities for young readers of this excellent acquisition for any library."</p>
