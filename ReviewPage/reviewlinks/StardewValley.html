						<strong>Story</strong></br> 
						Player Driven Story
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<strong>Gameplay</strong></br>
						Stardew Valley is a farming simulation game primarily inspired by the Harvest Moon video game series.
						At the start of the game, the player creates their character, with them becoming the recipient of a plot of land and a 
						small house once owned by their grandfather in a small town called Stardew Valley. The player may select one of 
						five farm maps (introduced in version 1.1) according to their preference in play style, such as one with extra 
						foraging opportunities, one with more mining resources, and another with a fishing river. The farm plot is initially 
						overrun with boulders, trees, stumps, and weeds, and the player must work to clear them in order to restart the farm, 
						tending to crops and livestock so as to generate revenue and further expand the farm's buildings and facilities.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The player may also interact with non-player characters (NPC) that inhabit the town, including engaging in relationships with these characters; 
						this can culminate in marriage, which results in the NPC helping the player's character to tend the farm. The player can also engage in fishing, 
						cooking, and crafting, and also explore procedurally-generated caves with materials and ores to mine or battle creatures within. 
						The player can take on various quests to earn additional money, or work at completing specific collections of materials offered at the 
						town's Community Center to gain additional rewards. All of these activities must be metered against the character's current health, 
						exhaustion level, and the game's internal clock. If the character becomes too exhausted, they will be returned to their house and restored 
						with energy on the morning of the next day, but having forgone any opportunities to continue in activities from the previous day. If the 
						player loses too much health, they will lose most of their energy and a random amount of money and items. The game uses a simplified calendar, 
						each year having only four 28-day months that represent each season, which determines which crops can be grown and which activities can be 
						beneficial. The character is evaluated on their third year. There is otherwise no deadline for completing the game, and as of 1.1 the player 
						can be re-evaluated.
